# Hangman_Game
This repository contains a command-line based Hangman game built in Python, a classic word-guessing game where players try to identify a hidden word one letter at a time. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess it within a limited number of incorrect attempts (typically 6). For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn, bringing the player closer to losing.

This project is perfect for beginners and intermediate Python developers looking to practice or demonstrate their understanding of:

Basic control flow (if-else, loops)

Functions and modular code structure

Lists, strings, and dictionaries

User input handling and validation

ASCII art for visual feedback

Error handling and edge-case management

Players are prompted to guess one letter per turn, and the game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of allowed attempts. The game includes:

A clean, text-based interface

Tracking of guessed and remaining letters

Case-insensitive input handling

Replay functionality after each round

This project is educational and demonstrates how traditional games can be recreated using simple programming logic. It is completely standalone and requires only Python to runâ€”no external libraries or frameworks are needed.
